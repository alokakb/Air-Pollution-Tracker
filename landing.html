					<h2>Air Pollution</h2>
					<p>Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole.
					Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of human and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are different types of air pollutants, such as gases (such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons, particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.

		<a name = "air" class="air" ><h1>Causes of Air Pollution</h1></a>
		<p class="desca">Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, volcanoes and wildfires. The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols.
		Air pollution happens when aerosols and certain gases end up in our air. These particles and gases can be bad for the planet and for our health, so keeping track of them is important.

					<h3>The Burning of Fossil Fuels</h3>
					<p>Most of the air pollution takes place due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gasoline to produce energy for electricity or transportation. The release of carbon monoxide in high level indicates how much fossil fuel is burned. This also emits other toxic pollutants in the air. Sulphur dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, petroleum for energy in power plants, and other factory combustibles is one the major cause of air pollution.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Exhaust from Factories and Industries</h3>
					<p>Industrial activities emit several pollutants in the air that affects the air quality more than we can even imagine. Manufacturing industries release a large amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air, thereby depleting the quality of air. Particulate matter 2.5 and 10, Nitrogen dioxide, Sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide are key pollutants that are emitted from industries that use coal and wood as their primary energy source for production of their goods.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Transportation</h3>
					<p>There is no denying that vehicle pollution is the major contributor to air pollution, especially in urban cities. When the car burns gasoline, it emits pollutants in the air which is as harmful as smoking 10 cigarettes a day. Your vehicle emits carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. When the vehicle pollution is high in the atmosphere, it creates a hole in the ozone layer contributing to smog and causing various health issues.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="abc">
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Wildfires</h3>
					<p>Climate change is not just increasing wildfire but also spiking air pollution. Burning stubble and farm residue is also a major contribution to wildfire. It causes increased PM 2.5 in the air which collides with other harmful substances like chemical gas and pollen creating smog. Smog makes the air hazy and people find it difficult to breathe.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Microbial Decaying Process</h3>
					<p>Manufacturing, chemical, and textiles industries release a large number of carbon monoxides, hydrocarbons, chemicals and organic compounds which contaminate our environment.  Bacteria and fungi play a fundamental role in the biogeochemical cycles in nature. Decaying of these microorganisms present in the surrounding releases methane gas which is highly toxic. Landfills are land areas in which waste is deposited or buried. These deposited or buried wastes generate methane. Methane is a major greenhouse gas that is highly flammable and very hazardous.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Agricultural Activities</h3>
					<p>Agricultural activities have had a serious impact on the decreasing air quality. To begin with pesticides and fertilizers are the main source to contaminate the surrounding air. Ammonia is a very common byproduct of agriculture-related activities and is one of the most hazardous gases in the atmosphere. The use of insecticides, pesticides, and fertilizers in agricultural activities has grown quite a lot. They emit harmful chemicals into the air.
						Farmers also set the field and old crops on fire in order to keep them clean for the next round of sowing. The burning to clean fields is said to cause pollution by releasing harmful gases in the air.
						</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="abc">
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Open Burning of Garbage Waste</h3>
					<p>Open burning of garbage is much more harmful to your health and the environment than one may think. Exposure to open burning of garbage waste can pose serious health risk including cancer, liver issues, impairment of immune system, reproductive functions; can also affect the developing nervous system.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Indoor Air Pollution</h3>
					<p>Talking about air pollution, we always consider outdoor air pollution dangerous for our lives but never talk about indoor air pollution. Household products cause indoor air pollution which is 10 times more harmful than outdoor air pollution. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) found in paints, cleaners and personal care products such as perfume and deodorants are a reason for common heath issues. Risks like asthma or other respiratory issues and lung disease are other issues cause by inhaling poor house air quality.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Natural Events</h3>
					<p>There are certain natural events such as volcanoes, forest fires, and dust storms, which are natural born and causes Air Pollution.

				<p class="descw">Like people, animals, and plants, entire ecosystems can suffer effects from air pollution. Haze, like smog, is a visible type of air pollution that obscures shapes and colors. Hazy air pollution can even muffle sounds.

					Air pollution particles eventually fall back to Earth. Air pollution can directly contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil. This can kill crops or reduce their yield. It can kill young trees and other plants.
					
					Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide particles in the air, can create acid rain when they mix with water and oxygen in the atmosphere. These air pollutants come mostly from coal-fired power plants and motor vehicles. When acid rain falls to Earth, it damages plants by changing soil composition; degrades water quality in rivers, lakes and streams; damages crops; and can cause buildings and monuments to decay.
					
					Like humans, animals can suffer health effects from exposure to air pollution. Birth defects, diseases, and lower reproductive rates have all been attributed to air pollution.</p>

		<a name = "air" class="air" ><h1>How to Reduce Air Pollution </h1></a>
		<p class="desca" style="color:black; font-size: 20px;">There are ways to prevent, control and eventually reduce air pollution.In addition, monitoring air pollution levels has become very important to detect pollution peaks, better control air pollution and eventually improve air quality.There are numerous pollution control devices which have been developed to reduce the pollution. They are being extensively used in industries. Though, they have their limitations still they are helping the industrial world to reduce pollution to some extent.

				<div class="prosair" >
					<h3>Renewable fuel and clean energy production</h3>
					<p>The most basic solution for air pollution is to move away from fossil fuels, replacing them with alternative energies like solar, wind and geothermal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Energy conservation and efficiency</h3>
					<p>Producing clean energy is crucial. But equally important is to reduce our consumption of energy by adopting responsible habits and using more efficient devices.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3> Eco-friendly transportation</h3>
					<p>Shifting to electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles, and promoting shared mobility (i.e carpooling, and public transports) could reduce air pollution.Alternative fuels include bio-diesel, bio-alcohol (methanol, ethanol, butane) and other biomass sources.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="def">
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Cyclone separator</h3>
					<p>Cyclones—also referred to as cyclone dust collectors—are air pollution control devices 		which, similarly to air filters, separate dry particulate matter from gaseous emissions.  
						<p>Its efficiency is 50-99%.It is low cost.It suitables for 10-100µm particles.</p>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Wet scrubber(Venturi scrubber)</h3>
					<p>A wet scrubber or wet scrubber system is one type of scrubber that is used to remove harmful materials from industrial exhaust gases—known as flue gas—before they are released into the environment. It was the original type of scrubbing system, and utilizes a wet substance to remove acidic gases that contribute to acid rain.
					<p>Its efficiency is 95-99%.
					   It is also low capital cost.
					   It is suitable for 2.5-10µm particles.
					</p>						
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Electrostatic Precipitators</h3>
					<p>Electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), like air filters and cyclones, are air pollution control devices used to collect and remove particulate matter, such as dust, from industrial emissions and exhaust.  
						<p>Its efficiency is 99% for PM10 and 68-95% for PM2.5.
						It is also relatively low cost.
						It is suitable for 0.02-2.5µm particles.
						</p>
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="def">
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Dry scrubber</h3>
					<p>A dry scrubber or dry scrubber system is one type of scrubber that is used to remove harmful materials from industrial exhaust gases before they are released into the environment. Dry scrubbers are the type most commonly used in plants today, and they utilize a collection of dry substances to remove acidic gases that contribute to acid rain. Dry scrubbers are used mainly to remove acid gases from combustion sources.
						<p>It is just like wet scrubber.
						It is more preferable than wet scrubber due to low wastage generation.
						</p>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Artificial Tree</h3>
					<p>Another great modern innovation is the artificial tree. These “super trees” intake 200,000 cubic meters of polluted air each day, expelling only pure oxygen in exchange. This is done through the innovative and creative use of a water filtration system.
						<p>It is equivalent to 250-350 natural trees.
						It removes 240 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
						It is easy to maintain.
						It is highly expensive.
						</p>						
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="prosair">
					<h3>Others methods to control air pollution</h3>
					<p>Fossil fuels power plants:- It is 60% of power generation.
						Non fossil fuels power plants:-It is 40% of power generation.
						Produce electric cars/vechiles.
						Alternative fuels include bio-diesel, bio-alcohol (methanol, ethanol, butane) and   other biomass sources.

			<a name = "water" class="water textcol" style="color: black;"><h1>Steps Taken By Government </h1></a>
			<p class="descw" style="color: black;">In 2015, Government of India, together with IIT Kanpur launched the National Air Quality Index.
				In 2019, India launched 'The National Clean Air Programme' with tentative national target of 20%-30% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024, considering 2017 as the base year for comparison. It will be rolled out in 102 cities that are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
			   The government in Delhi launched an Odd-Even Rule in November, 2017 which is based on the Odd-Even rationing method: This meant that cars running with number plates ending in Odd digits could only be driven on certain days of the week, while the Even digit cars could be driven on the remaining days of the week.
			   Local governments of various states also implemented measures such as tighter vehicle emissions' norms, higher penalties for burning rubbish and better control of road dust.
			   
			   In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St. Louis, launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in India.
			   In January 2019, the government launched the National Clean Air Program (NCAP), a five-year action plan to curb air pollution, build a pan-India air quality monitoring network, and improve citizen awareness. The programme focuses on city-specific action plans that will be developed for 102 cities in India that exceed national air quality safeguards. It aims to reduce PM2.5 levels by 20-30 percent by 2024 (compared to 2017 levels).
			   The Indian government has committed to a 50% reduction in households using solid fuel for cooking.
